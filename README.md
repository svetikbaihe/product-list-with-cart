## My process

### Built with

- HTML markup
- Typescript
- React
- React-Responsive
- SCSS/SASS
- Tailwind
- Ant Design
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ESLint + Prettier
- Vite

### What I learned

First of all, I would like to talk about the new things I have learned
throughout this project. I used the Ant Design UI framework for the first time,
and I can say that it was not easy. As with any other new framework, library, or
feature, working efficiently with Ant Design requires time and patience. I am
100% sure that I missed something with the theme. Also, customizing components
was a great challenge as well.

This is my second React project, and I am still learning how to use it. In this
project, I incorporated different hooks such as useMemo, useCallback, and
useReducer alongside useContext.

I added some additional features that were not originally described in the
challenge. If you look at the screenshots, you can see that I added a 'list-grid
switcher', moved the cart and the empty cart component into separate modals, and
the design overall slightly differs from the original one. On top of that, I am
planning to expand this project a little by adding routing and some pages just
to practice react-router.

### Continued development

There is still a lot of work to be done with hooks, Ant Design concepts, and
React itself. Oh, and I still have some issues with ESLint. I must admit that
setting up the project from scratch is truly a distinct form of art.

### Useful resources

- [React](https://react.dev/) - Everyone who learns React should peruse this
  documentation.
- [MockupBro](https://mockupbro.com/) - This is a great online mockup generator.
- [PIXLR](https://pixlr.com/) - Perfect free online photo editor for easy and
  quick collages.
